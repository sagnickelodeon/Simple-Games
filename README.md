# Simple-Games
This repo contains some simple games developed by me using python and the graphics.py module

I created all of these nearly 1.5 - 2 years ago, back when I didn't follow proper code formatting techniques. Now, I don't remember the function of every line, and thus modifying the code may make it crash. So I couldn't implement proper formatting even now.

The games here are:

1. Changing Maze - The player controls a character, and a target is given. However, whenever the player presses a movement button, the maze changes. The challenge is to reach the target. Press Arrow keys to move.
2. Cricket - As name suggests, this is a simple cricket game. User can select number of players in a team. Press X to hit the ball and UP/DOWN arrow keys to take a run.
3. Escape - The player starts from the top left, and the goal is to reach bottom right. However, there are multiple killers which will move randomly. If any killer touches the player, the game ends. Press arrow keys to move.
4. Football - A simple football game with 5 players on each side. Only the player (both user and bot) closest to the ball will be able to move. Press arrow keys to move and X to shoot the ball.
5. Minesweeper - Classic minesweeper. Red tile means it is unchecked. Clicking on a red tile once will make it yellow, suggesting a possible mine. Clicking on a yellow mine will remove the tile and expose what's underneath.
6. Pong - A computer-vs-computer game of pong. No user interaction required.
7. Shoot - A simple shooter game. Several agents are roaming randomly, and if the player is in a direct line with them they will fire at the player, which if hit successfully will decrease the player's health bar. User too can shoot the agents. The goal is to kill all agents. Press arrow keys to move vertically/horizontally, and QRZC to move diagonally. Press X to shoot.

All of the games here have extremely basic GUI, with circles used to denote player/agents. I apologise for the poor formatting.
